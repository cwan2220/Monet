# The creative coding major project (Time-Based animation)
Produced by Chengyu Wang (SID: 510537047; Unikey: cwan2220)
The sky section in the final code was a combination of several sources of inspiration and code references, aiming to create a unique look to the visual scene.
Use the expression frameCount % 60 == 0 to detect the time to ensure that the changeColors function is triggered at a specific time interval, and the sky part will generate new random colors every second.
Likewise, the colors of the river and church were changed to match or complement the colors of the sky, creating a harmonious visual effect. 
This utilization of a time-based control demonstrates how, through the frameCount variable and timed events, it can animate certain graphic properties at specific intervals to create more engaging and dynamic animations.
Please enjoy the iterations of Time-Based (3 generation)
